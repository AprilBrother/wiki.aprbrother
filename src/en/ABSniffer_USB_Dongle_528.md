You can also program connectivity firmware from nordic. Which mean you
can use pc-ble-driver to drive the dongle. pc-ble-driver consists of a
set of static and shared libraries that provide serial port
communication (using SoftDevice API serialization) to an nRF5x IC
running the connectivity firmware included. Javascript and Python
binding for pc-ble-driver are available.

If you want to reprogram this devices you must use a J-Link.

## About Default Firmware ABSniffer

The ABSniffer firmware provide the features to scan advertisement data
from BLE device nearby. It's preloaded with ABSniffer 528. It has better
performance than previous ABSniffer. It can get 100+ BLE advertisement
data per second.
