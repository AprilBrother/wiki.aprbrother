## Performance

* Scan duration = 1 second
* Upload maximum 210 advertsing data per second with Ethernet wire
* Upload maximum 150 advertsing data per second with WiFi connection

## Data Format

Gateway V4 post data in [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) format. MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. We can get more library for programming languages to parse MessagePack.

### Keys

The data decoded is a dictionary with these keys:

  - v - firmware version
  - mid - message ID
  - time - boot time
  - ip - the IP for gateway
  - rssi - the RSSI of WiFi connection for gateway. It appears when using WiFi connection from firmware v1.5.0
  - iccid - the ICCID of 4G module. It appears when using 4G connection from firmware v1.5.3
  - mac - the mac address for gateway
  - devices - an array for BLE advertising datas that gateway collected

The devices array contain RAW advertising data for BLE device. An example hex data frame, see the section "Data Format For Key Devices"

`00 12 3b 6a 1a 64 cf aa 02 01 06 1a ff 4c 00 02 15 b5 b1 82 c7 ea b1 49 88 aa 99 b5 c1 51 70 08 d9 00 01 cf 64 c5`

| Bytes      | Description                           | Example |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| byte 1     | advertising type, see the table below | 00 |
| byte 2 - 7 | mac address for BLE device            | `12 3b 6a 1a 64 cf` |
| byte 8     | RSSI, minus 256 for real value        | aa, 0xaa - 256 = -86 |
| byte 9 -   | Advertisement data                    | 02 01 06 1a ff 4c 00 02 15 b5 b1 82 c7 ea b1 49 88 aa 99 b5 c1 51 70 08 d9 00 01 cf 64 c5 |

| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Connectable undirected advertisement     |
| 1    | Connectable directed advertisement       |
| 2    | Scannable undirected advertisement       |
| 3    | Non-Connectable undirected advertisement |
| 4    | Scan Response                            |

## Hardware

### LED Status

The ethernet port has a green LED and a yellow LED. 

| Color |  Description |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | 
| Green | Blink when ethernet start | 
| Yellow | Turn on when it got IP address |
