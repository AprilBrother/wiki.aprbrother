## Description

The ESPea32 is a comprehensive development platform for Espressif’s
ESP32. The ESP32 is a WiFi-compatible microcontroller, but to that it
adds support for BLE, and more I/O pins.

What's difference ESPea32 with other ESP32 development board? It can be
cut down to smaller size if you need a smaller board. The board is also
part compatible with our [ESPea](ESPea.md) development board.

In addition to the WiFi/BLE SoC, the ESPea32 includes an CP2104, which
converts USB to serial, and allows your computer to program and
communicate with the microcontroller.

A USB interface that lets you quickly use it with the Arduino IDE

## Pinouts

<img src="https://i1.aprbrother.com/espea32-pinouts.png">

Both I2C interfaces are supported by the Wire library. The SDA and SCL
pins are assigned, by default, to pins 21 and 22.

|     |       |
| --- | ----- |
| I2C | ESP32 |
| SDA | 21    |
| SCL | 22    |
|  |

And the SPI library should support all three possible SPI interfaces. By
default, here are the pin mappings for those interfaces:

|      |       |
| ---- | ----- |
| SPI  | ESP32 |
| MOSI | 23    |
| MISO | 19    |
| SCLK | 18    |
| SS   | 5     |
