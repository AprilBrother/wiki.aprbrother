@tab Forward data to HTTP server

To quickly validate that data is correctly received on the target computer on the host network, it is possible to run `gw-http-box` standalone to listen for HTTP POSTs on port `8000` as follows:

* Install Node.js
* Git and console are required
* Run command in the console
```
git clone https://github.com/aprilbrother/gw-http-box.git
npm install
npm start
```
- Change application settings for gateway and save
  - Application Type: `HTTP Client`
  - HTTP Host: The IP of your laptop, e.g. `192.168.1.123`
  - HTTP Port: 8000
  - URI: `/`
- Select `Save` to proceed

If the gateway is correctly configured and at least one BLE device is advertising in range, gateway data should appear in the console.
