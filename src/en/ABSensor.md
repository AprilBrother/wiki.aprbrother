## ABSensor N07

N07 is a BLE beacon with temperature and humidity sensor. It advertises the temperature/humidity data with BTHome protocol.

BTHome is an open standard protocol for broadcasting sensor data. It is supported by popular home automation platforms, like Home Assistant, out of the box.

* Nordic solution, long battery life. The BLE chip is NRF52820                                                   
* Temperature and humidity sensor (GXHT30) for environment monitoring
* Power supply by CR2450 Battery `500~` mAh (replaceable).
* Dimensions: `40mm x 40mm x 13.5mm`
* One LED and one button
