<translate> There are a few requirements on the mobile device side that
must be met for the entire experience to work as expected.

  - An eligible app installed on a mobile device
  - A mobile device's Bluetooth® Smart hardware must be switched on
  - If content is not embedded into your app, a WIFI or a cellular
    connection for content delivery to a mobile device. The latter is
    recommended.

## iOS 7 Background App Refresh

Background App Refresh is a global setting that allows apps to refresh
their content when on a WIFI or cellular connection, or use Location
Service, in the background.

If you turn off Background App Refresh, no app can update in the
background; or you can allow only some apps to update in the background.
If you close an app from the multitasking interface, it may not be able
to refresh in the background but it can continue to send notifications.

You can adjust your apps' background activity in iOS 7 by tapping on
Settings \> General \> Background App Refresh.

Note: Push notifications require a WIFI or a cellular connection. WIFI
is used when a cellular connection is not available. </translate>
